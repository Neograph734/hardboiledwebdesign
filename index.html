<h3 class="item__header"><a href="javascript:void(0)">The Simple Art of Murder</a></h3>

<p class="tertiary">The Simple Art of Murder refers to both a critical essay and a collection of short stories written by hard-boiled detective fiction author Raymond Chandler. The essay was first published in The Atlantic Monthly in December 1944. It was reprinted in 1950 along with eight of Chandler&#8217;s early stories pre-dating his first novel, The Big Sleep. The essay is considered a seminal piece of literary criticism. Although Chandler&#8217;s primary topic is the art (and failings) of detective fiction, he touches on general literature and modern society as well.</p>
