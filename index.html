<h1>Time to get hardboiled</h1>

<p class="lead">In hardboiled detective stories since the 1920s, crime, violence and characters—both good and bad—have been portrayed without a veneer of sentimentality. The term ‘hardboiled’ means tough, like an overcooked egg. The crimes are tough too, so the heroes have attitude, don’t sugar-coat the truth and never play it cute. They&#8212;and, by association, we as readers&#8212;demand the truth, no matter what it takes and how rotten it might be.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption__columns">Hardboiled heroes are almost always down at heel, usually broke, often drunk and living on a diet of black coffee and smokes—hey, that sounds like most web designers I know. They have a good woman to help them stay on the straight and narrow but don’t always treat her as well as they should. When a glamorous redhead walks in the room, a hardboiled hero can’t help but turn his head. (OK, this is getting weird. I could be describing myself.)</figcaption>

<p class="tertiary">The Long Good-bye is a 1953 novel by Raymond Chandler, centered on his famous detective Philip Marlowe. While some consider it not on the level of The Big Sleep or Farewell, My Lovely, others rank it as the best of his work. It is notable for using hard-boiled detective fiction as a vehicle for social criticism. It is also known for having autobiographical elements that relate to Chandler's life.</p>
