<p class="lead">The Maltese Falcon is a 1941 film noir directed by John Huston in his directorial debut. Huston&#8217;s screenplay was based on the novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett. The film stars Humphrey Bogart as private investigator Sam Spade and Mary Astor as his femme fatale client.</p>

<p>The story follows a San Francisco private detective and his dealings with three unscrupulous adventurers, all of whom are competing to obtain a jewel-encrusted falcon statuette. The film premiered on October 3, 1941, in New York City, and was nominated for three Academy Awards. The Maltese Falcon was selected for inclusion in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry in 1989.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption__columns">Hardboiled heroes are almost always down 	at heel, usually broke, often drunk and living on a diet of black coffee and smokes&#8212;hey, that sounds like most web designers I know. They have a good woman to help them stay on the straight and narrow but don’t always treat her as well as 	they should. When a glamorous redhead walks in the room, a hardboiled hero can’t help but turn his head.</figcaption>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<p>Following a September 1941 preview, Variety called it &#8220;one of the best examples of action-full and suspenseful melodramatic story telling in cinematic form.&#8221;</p>


<blockquote class="quote--centered">
<p class="secondary">Unfolding a most intriguing and entertaining murder mystery, picture displays outstanding excellence in writing, direction, acting and editing—combining in overall as a prize package of entertainment for widest audience appeal. Due for hefty grosses in all runs, it&#8217;s textured with ingredients presaging numerous holdovers in the keys&#8212;and strong word-of-mouth will make the b.o. wickets spin.</p>

<blockquote class="e-description">
<p class="secondary">With its dark, complex plotting, stark black-and-white photography, concentration on the baseness of man, and a cynical mood sustained to its still shockingly grim conclusion, this is the prototypical film noir.</p>

<h3>Hardboiled detectives</h3>

<p>Hardboiled fiction is a literary genre that shares some of its characters and settings with crime fiction (especially detective stories). Derived from the romantic tradition which emphasised the emotions of apprehension, awe, horror and terror, hardboiled fiction deviates from that tradition in the detective&#8217;s cynical attitude towards those emotions.</p>
