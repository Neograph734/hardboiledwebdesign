<div class="p-summary">

<p class="lead">In 1941 San Francisco, private investigators Sam Spade and Miles Archer meet prospective client Ruth Wonderly. She claims to be looking for her missing sister, who is involved with a man named Floyd Thursby. Wonderly is to meet Thursby. After receiving a substantial retainer, Archer agrees to follow her that night and help get her sister back.</p>

<p>In 1539 the Knight Templars of Malta, paid tribute to Charles V of Spain, by sending him a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewelsâ€”but pirates seized the galley carrying this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Falcon remains a mystery to this day.</p>

<h2>Motive to kill</h2>

<p>That night, Spade is awakened by a phone call and informed that Archer has been killed. He meets his friend, Police Detective Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond), at the murder scene. He then calls Wonderly&#8217;s hotel, but she has checked out. He is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), who inform him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening. Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby, who likely killed Archer. Archer&#8217;s widow Iva (Gladys George) believes that Spade shot his partner so he could have her.</p>

<p>Later that morning, Spade meets Wonderly, now calling herself Brigid O&#8217;Shaughnessy. She explains that Thursby was her partner and probably killed Archer, but claims to have no idea who killed Thursby. Spade is not convinced, but agrees to investigate the murders.</p>

<h1 class="section__header">Raymond Chandler</h1>

<div class="columns">

<p class="secondary">Raymond Thornton Chandler was an American novelist and screenwriter. In 1932, at age forty-four, Chandler decided to become a detective fiction writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the Great Depression. His first short story, &#8216;Blackmailers Don&#8217;t Shoot,&#8217; was published in 1933 in Black Mask, a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, &#8216;The Big Sleep,&#8217; was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth in progress at his death was completed by Robert B. Parker). All but Playback have been made into motion pictures, some several times. In the year before he died, he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America.</p>

<h1 class="section__header">Mickey Spillane</h1>

<div class="columns-spillane">

<p class="secondary">Frank Morrison Spillane was an American author of crime novels, many featuring his signature detective character, Mike Hammer. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. When literary critics had a negative reaction to Spillane&#8217;s writing&#8212;citing the high content of sex and violence&#8212;Spillane answered with a few terse comments: &#8220;Those big-shot writers could never dig the fact that there are more salted peanuts consumed than caviar&#8230;&#8221; If the public likes you, you're good.&#8221;</p>
