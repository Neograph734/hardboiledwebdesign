<!-- $pattern-example-long Pulp magazines (often referred to as &#8220;the pulps&#8221;) are inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 through the &#8217;50s. The term pulp derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed; in contrast, magazines printed on higher quality paper were called &#8220;glossies&#8221; or &#8220;slicks.&#8221; The typical pulp magazine had 128 pages; it was 7 inches (18 cm) wide by 10 inches (25 cm) high, and 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) thick, with ragged, untrimmed edges. -->
